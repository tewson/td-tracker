# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project and for taking the time to read this!

## What can I contribute?

Contributions to this project can probably be divided into 2 categories: code and data.

### Code

We have the main TD Tracker app and the data entry app. Both share a lot of code and can be built from this repository.

#### Technologies

This project is written in [React](https://reactjs.org) and the apps are deployed as static web pages.

#### Code style

We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting and [ESLint](https://eslint.org) for linting. Check out our [ESLint config](https://github.com/tewson/td-tracker/blob/master/.eslintrc.json).

### Data

Most of the data we use such as vote and debate records comes from the [Houses of the Oireachtas Open Data APIs](https://api.oireachtas.ie/). However, attendance data still needs to be taken from the monthly-published records of attendance and entered by hand. Fortunately, this project has an app that helps with data entry.
